            <h2>YOUR REAL REFERENCE LEVEL</h2>
            <p>We automatically — and mostly without realizing — set a reference level for everything we do. Sometimes we even limit ourselves because of this. Reference levels define how far we can learn and move forward in our lives. Although we have these levels, we are not aware of them as they become automatic and guide our lives.</p>
            <P>You can practice learning a new skill by working for it 1 hour a day and quit after a while because it looks and feels so difficult. On the other hand, you can decide to increase the duration of your practice, redesign your learing strategy and learn that skill step by step to conquer your limit on that.</P>

            <h2>WHEN YOU LEARN > HOW YOU LEARN?</h2>
            <p>Not all of us are fit to work with the same performance during the same time of the day. Some of us learn like they’re born to do it in the morning while others do the same at noon or after midnight. Such a difference completely OK, while it is up to us to find out when we learn best.</p>
            <p>Consider this: You learn much better at night and despite long study hours during the morning, your short studies during the night time easily outperforms the morning ones. In this case, it is better to shift your focus to the night time to get the best of you. Remember, the point is to get the best of you.</p>
